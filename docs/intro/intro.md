# Introductio
## Wave's philosophy and goals
Wave aims to completely replace low-level languages (such as C and assembly) and establish an integrated ecosystem where everything can be developed using a single language. 
This language encompasses all fields, including web development, programming, operating systems, artificial intelligence, 
blockchain, hardware, compilers, networking, and cryptography, providing high-level abstraction through a powerful standard library.

In particular, Wave's hardware library is designed to be easy to use, even for those who do not have deep knowledge of hardware. 
Additionally, it offers the flexibility to control hardware directly and precisely without using this library if necessary. 
This allows developers to intuitively utilize various hardware features while maximizing performance.

Wave seeks to eliminate the boundaries between languages in the development process through its integrated language environment, 
providing a more intuitive and cohesive development experience.

## Key Features and Characteristics of Wave
1. Integrated Language Structure
Wave is designed as a single language that encompasses all development areas, including web, software, and operating systems.
This allows developers to complete all projects using one language, eliminating the need to learn multiple languages.

2. High-Level Abstraction
Wave supports the execution of complex tasks simply through a powerful standard library.
Users can perform high-level operations without worrying about low-level details, maximizing development productivity.

3. Ease of Hardware Access
The hardware library in Wave is designed to be accessible even for users with limited knowledge of hardware. 
4. By using this library, developers can easily handle complex hardware controls. 
Additionally, it offers options for direct control when fine-tuning hardware is necessary.

4. Performance Optimization
Wave is engineered to maintain excellent performance even in low-level tasks where performance is critical. 
An optimized compiler and efficient memory management features ensure top performance across various applications.

5. Modularity and Reusability 
Wave allows for modular code development, increasing code reusability and simplifying maintenance. 
Developers can manage necessary functionalities in separate modules, reducing the overall complexity of projects.

6. Robust Error Handling and Debugging Support
Wave provides strong error handling and debugging capabilities, enabling developers to easily identify and fix errors in their code. 
Intuitive error messages and debugging tools enhance productivity throughout the development process.

## Wave's Roadmap and Plans
The development roadmap for Wave aims for continuous improvement and expansion, including the following key plans:

1. Expansion of Core Language Features
Building on the basic syntax and features provided in the initial version, future updates will introduce more advanced features and syntax structures.
This may include pattern matching, support for asynchronous programming, and advanced data structures.

2. Enhancement of Standard Library
The standard library of Wave will be continuously expanded over time. 
We plan to add various features tailored to user needs, enabling developers to work more easily and efficiently.

3. Improvement of Hardware Library
The hardware library is one of the core elements of Wave, and it will be improved to enhance compatibility with various hardware and to add new features. 
We will continuously develop it to allow users to more easily access and control hardware.

4. Incorporation of Community Feedback
We will actively incorporate feedback from users and the developer community to improve the quality of the language and libraries and enhance usability. 
To facilitate this, we plan to operate forums and feedback channels to gather user opinions.

5. Provision of Documentation and Educational Materials
The documentation of Wave will be an ongoing effort, and we will provide various educational materials and tutorials to assist in learning the language. 
This will support new users in easily learning and utilizing Wave.

6. Support for Various Platforms
Wave plans to expand its support to operate on a variety of platforms. 
We will develop it to function smoothly across different operating systems, including Windows, macOS, and Linux.

7. Strengthening Collaboration with the Community
To foster the growth and development of Wave, we will enhance collaboration with the open-source community. 
We will express our gratitude to contributors and provide opportunities for them to participate directly in the advancement of Wave, working towards our shared goals.
